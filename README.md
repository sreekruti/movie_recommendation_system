# movie_recommendation_system
In order to recommend films, our system uses a cosine similarity algorithm, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and a content-based movie recommendation system (MRS).
This system is trained by understanding customers' actions and activities.
The primary benefit of this method is that the algorithm is built to function effectively with only a minimal collection of data. 
The recommendations are based on the user's preferences, history, user profile information, and knowledge of the movie's plot. 
The users can save time, and in the future, there will be improvements like a data analytics portal that will let the movie creators analyse and track how well each user responds to a particular genre or video. 
Additionally, more effective recommendation systems expand their market reach.
